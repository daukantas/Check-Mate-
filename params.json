April 2017 .Pilot project: the development of online tools for beginning teachers and their mentors. \r\nhttps://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-display.html?cftId=1625\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this contract is to contribute to the improvement of European-level policy development in education and training. The specific objective of this contract is to increase self-efficacy of beginning teachers to become effective professionals. It will involve the development of online peer networks for (a) beginning teachers and (b) their mentors, as well as (c) an online professional development course for mentors of student school teachers.\r\n\r\n<?php include('header.php') ?> \r\n2 \r\n \r\n3         <h2>Evo<span class=\"red\">COMNET</span> 2017<h2> \r\n4    </div> \r\n5 \r\n \r\n6 <p><strong>Application of Nature-inspired Techniques for Communication Networks and \r\n7 other Parallel and Distributed Systems</strong></p> \r\n8 <?php include('common_to_all.php') ?> \r\n9 \r\n \r\n10 <?php include('common_to_apps.php') ?> \r\n11 \r\n \r\n12 \r\n \r\n13 \r\n \r\n14 \r\n \r\n15 \r\n \r\n16 Evo<span class=\"red\">COMNET</span> solicits contributions dealing with the application of ideas from natural processes and systems to the definition, analysis, and development of novel sequential, parallel, and distributed evolutionary computation approaches to the solution of problems of practical and theoretical interest in all domains related to network systems.
